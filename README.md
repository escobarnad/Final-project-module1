## Description
### **Goal of the game:**
Itâ€™s a football match. You have to take the player to the finish line and score goals. Avoid the defenders since they will take your lives.

### **How does it work?**
Using W-A-S-P on your keyboard, move the player through the field. You have to dodge the defenders and score 5 goals to win. If the defenders get you 3 times, you lose.


## MVP

- There is a start-game screen with instructions on how to use the game.
- The player changes directions by using W-A-S-D on your keyboard.
- There are defenders moving down in the field.
- The defenders appear at random placements. Both horizontally and vertically.
- The game ends when you win or you lose. 
- You lose when the defenders collide with the player and you lose your 3 lifes. 
- You win when you score 5 goals.
- There is an end-game screen


## Backlog

- ~~Make 6 defenders bounce up and down on their own.~~
- ~~Make defenders reappear closer to the goal line whenever they collide with the player adding difficulty to the game~~
- ~~Add sound to the game-screen.~~
- ~~Have 2 different screens for losing or winning.~~
- Add a different sound when the player scores the goal.
- The player could also shoot the ball from distance.
